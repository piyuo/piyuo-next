# piyuo-next

piyuo-next is the official website for piyuo counter. This project uses Next.js/React with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to build a small, fast, and most importantly, Search Engine Optimized (SEO) website with dynamic content capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

These tools are used to support local development, collaboration, and testing:

- Visual Studio Code ‚Äì Recommended code editor with official Next.js and Tailwind CSS extensions.
- Node.js (v18+) ‚Äì Required runtime for Next.js and tooling.
- pnpm ‚Äì Preferred package manager (faster and more efficient than npm/yarn).
- Git ‚Äì Version control for managing source code.
- GitHub CLI (gh) ‚Äì Streamlines GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests, etc.).
- Playwright Test Runner ‚Äì Used for running end-to-end tests locally and in CI.
- Jest ‚Äì Unit testing framework with React Testing Library integration.
- ESLint + Prettier ‚Äì Enforces consistent code quality and formatting (integrated via VS Code extensions).
- Wrangler CLI ‚Äì Cloudflare's CLI tool for local development and deployment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Follow the instructions in the console to open the [URL] in your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id

# Optional: On-demand revalidation security
REVALIDATE_TOKEN=your_secure_token
```

For production deployment on Cloudflare Pages, set environment variables in the Cloudflare Dashboard under Pages > Settings > Environment variables.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: For static type safety across the codebase.
- **React**: Core UI framework.
- **Next.js (App Router)**: Handles routing, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and optimizations like `next/image`, `next/font`.
- **TurboPack**: For fast local development (enabled by Next.js).
- **next-intl**: For internationalization and multilingual support.
- **Tailwind CSS + clsx**: Utility-first CSS styling with conditional class management.
- **ShadCN UI**: Prebuilt, accessible, and Tailwind-compatible UI components.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management library.
- **SWR**: Data fetching strategy for REST APIs.
- **Zod**: Schema validation and form validation logic.
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling and integration with Zod.
- **Jest + React Testing Library**: Unit and component testing.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing.
- **Cloudflare Pages + Functions**: Production hosting with serverless functions support.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bundlers

- **Turbopack** is used for local development (enabled by Next.js).
- **Webpack** is used for production builds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency Management

This project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) for managing dependencies.

‚úÖ Please use:

```bash
pnpm install
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev
```

‚ùå Do NOT use npm install. It will either be blocked or crash due to pnpm's optimized node_modules layout.

If you don't have pnpm yet:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices to Follow

- Use TypeScript for all code.
- Follow Next.js App Router architecture.
- Use functional components and React hooks only.
- All styles should use Tailwind CSS.
- Leverage ISR for pages that benefit from both static generation and dynamic updates.
- Use server components for static content and client components for interactive features.
- Co-locate i18n messages with the page or component. Place all messages files in the `messages/` directory (see below).
- Validate all user input using Zod schemas.
- Prefer composable, reusable components.
- All new features and fixes must use TDD (write tests first).
- Ensure accessibility in UI components.
- Use concise, readable TypeScript.
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming and structure.
- Optimize ISR revalidation intervals based on content update frequency.

## üö´ What to Avoid

- Do not use class-based React components.
- Do not use Redux or other global state libraries; use Zustand only.
- Do not use CSS Modules or styled-components.
- Avoid GraphQL (use only REST + SWR).
- Avoid complex side effects outside of hooks or state stores.
- Don't set ISR revalidation too aggressively (avoid unnecessary server load).

## AI Agent Assistance Highlight

- Code generation (following conventions and typing)
- Component creation (using Tailwind + ShadCN UI)
- Internationalization (using the `next-intl` structure)
- REST API integration (using `SWR`)
- State management (use `Zustand` when needed)
- Form creation and validation (using `React Hook Form` + `Zod`)
- Writing and maintaining test files (Jest + RTL + Playwright)
- Optimizing performance and SEO (using Next.js ISR features)
- ISR configuration and revalidation strategies
- Cloudflare Pages and Functions integration
- Keeping the codebase clean and modular

## üîß Rendering Strategy

- The current deployment uses **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** for optimal performance and SEO.
- Pages are statically generated at build time and can be regenerated on-demand or at specified intervals.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is available for dynamic content when needed.
- Static pages are served from Cloudflare's global CDN for maximum performance.
- Dynamic functionality is handled by Cloudflare Functions (serverless edge computing).

### ISR Configuration

Pages can be configured with different revalidation strategies:

```tsx
// Static generation with 60-second revalidation
export const revalidate = 60;

// On-demand revalidation (triggered by API calls)
export const revalidate = false;

// Always fresh (equivalent to SSR)
export const revalidate = 0;
```

## Release

**Release-please** automatically handles versioning and releases by:

1. **Analyzing commit messages** on main branch
2. **Determining version type** based on conventional commits:
   - `feat:` commits ‚Üí Minor version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.2.0)
   - `fix:` commits ‚Üí Patch version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1)
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` ‚Üí Major version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
3. **Generating changelog** from commit messages and linked issues
4. **Creating release PR** with version bump and changelog
5. **Creating Git tags** when release PR is merged

### Milestone Completion

When all issues in a milestone are completed:

1. **Release-please creates release PR** automatically
2. **Maintainer reviews and merges** release PR to main
3. **Automatic version bump and changelog** generation
4. **Git tag created** with version number
5. **CI/CD deployment triggered** automatically

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

This project is automatically deployed to Cloudflare Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment workflow is triggered on every push to the main branch.

### Automated Deployment

The site is built and deployed using Cloudflare Pages' GitHub integration:

1. Builds the Next.js application with ISR support
2. Deploys static assets to Cloudflare's global CDN
3. Deploys serverless functions to Cloudflare Functions
4. Provides instant global distribution with edge caching

### Manual Deployment

For manual deployment using Wrangler CLI:

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI globally
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name=piyuo-next
```

### Local Development with Cloudflare

To test Cloudflare Functions locally:

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Run local development server with Functions
wrangler pages dev .next --compatibility-date=2024-01-15
```

### Environment Configuration

Configure environment variables in:

- **Development**: `.env.local` file
- **Production**: Cloudflare Dashboard > Pages > Settings > Environment variables

### Performance Benefits

The migration to Cloudflare Pages + ISR provides:

- **Faster Time to First Byte**: ISR serves cached content instantly
- **Better SEO**: Server-generated content with dynamic updates
- **Global Performance**: Cloudflare's 200+ edge locations
- **Automatic Scaling**: Serverless functions scale automatically
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model with generous free tier
