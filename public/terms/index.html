			non-commercial purposes</strong> on devices that you own or control.</p>

	<h2>4. Restrictions on Use</h2>
	<p>You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose, or otherwise
			<strong>commercially exploit the Service</strong> or make the App available to any third party for their
			commercial benefit. This includes, but is not limited to, using the App to provide paid pedestrian counting
			services to others.</li>
		<li>Modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, decrypt, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the
			Service.</li>
