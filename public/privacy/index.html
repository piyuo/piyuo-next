	<h1>Privacy Policy for Piyuo Counter</h1>

	<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 12, 2025</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Welcome to Piyuo Counter! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our software
		application ("App"). Our commitment is to your privacy. This App is designed to function without collecting or
		processing any of your personal data.</p>
	<p><strong>This Privacy Policy applies to the Piyuo Counter software application ("App") for mobile devices and
			computers, available across various platforms and application stores.</strong></p>

	<h2>Who We Are</h2>
	<p>The Piyuo Counter app is provided by Piyuo ("we," "us," or "our"). Our website is <a
			href="https://piyuo.com">https://piyuo.com</a>. If you have questions about this policy, you can contact us
		at <a href="mailto:service@piyuo.com">service@piyuo.com</a>.</p>

	<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
	<p><strong>We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information or usage data from you through
			the Piyuo Counter app.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not ask for, access, or track any information that could identify
			you, such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, or contacts.</li>
		<li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> The app does not record how you use it. All counter data you create is
			stored locally on your device only and is not accessible to us.</li>
		<li><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> We do not integrate any third-party services for analytics (like
			Firebase Analytics), advertising (like AdMob), cloud storage, or any other purpose that would involve
			sharing data with external parties. The app operates entirely offline in terms of data handling.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
	<p>Since we do not collect any information, we do not use your information for any purpose.</p>

	<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
	<p>We do not share or disclose any personal information because we do not collect any. Your data (the counts you
		track) stays on your device.</p>

	<h2>Data Security</h2>
	<p>Any data generated by using the Piyuo Counter app (such as your counts) is stored locally on your device only. We
		do not have access to this data. While we build our app with standard security practices, the security of the
		data stored on your device depends on the security measures you take for your device itself.</p>

	<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>Our App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children. We comply with the Children's
		Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US and similar regulations like GDPR regarding children's data. As
		we collect no data, we inherently do not collect data from children under the age of 13 (or 16 in some EU
		countries).</p>

	<h2>Your Rights (GDPR and Other Laws)</h2>
	<p>Privacy laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and various US state laws grant
		individuals rights over their personal data (like access, correction, deletion). </p>
	<p>Because the Piyuo Counter app does not collect, store, or process any of your personal data, these rights are
		generally not applicable in the context of our App, as there is no data held by us for you to access, correct,
		or delete. Any data related to the app resides solely on your device, under your control.</p>

	<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
		Policy within the App or on our website (<a href="https://piyuo.com">https://piyuo.com</a>). You are advised to
		review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
	<p>Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

	<h2>Contact Us</h2>
	<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
	<ul>
