# ðŸ”§ Workflow 1: Resolve Issue

<!--
===============================================
Document: AGENTS_RESOLVE_ISSUE.md
Purpose: Guide AI assistants through complete issue resolution from start to finish

Overview:
  - Complete end-to-end issue resolution workflow
  - Process Steps:
    1. Setup Branch â†’ Create proper branch and assign issue
    2. Test-First Development â†’ Write tests first, then develop solution
    3. Complete Development â†’ Use Workflow 3 patterns for ongoing work
    4. Create PR for Review â†’ Clean history, create PR, verify
    5. Clean Up â†’ Remove temporary files

Key Requirements:
  - Test-first development (â‰¥80% coverage mandatory)
  - Clean Git history before PR submission
  - Issue numbers in all commits
  - TOC at top of all code files

Critical Dependencies:
  - CONTRIBUTING.md â†’ Complete workflow details, testing requirements
  - README.md â†’ Tech stack and implementation constraints
  - Workflow 3 (AGENTS_DEVELOPMENT.md) â†’ Development patterns for Step 3
  - .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md â†’ PR body template
===============================================

**Trigger:** Human says "resolve issue #42" or "solve issue #42"
**Prerequisites:** None - this workflow handles complete issue resolution from start to finish

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Before starting, read CONTRIBUTING.md for complete workflow details and README.md for project-specific tech stack and implementation constraints.**

## Step 1: Setup Branch

```bash
./scripts/start_issue.sh <issue-number>
```

This creates the proper branch and assigns the issue.

**ðŸ“– Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md Step 1 for detailed branch creation instructions.**

### Step 2: Test-First Development

1. **Write tests first** (mandatory - â‰¥80% coverage)
2. **Develop solution** to make tests pass
3. **Iterate** until feature is complete

**ðŸ“– MANDATORY: Read CONTRIBUTING.md Step 2 for test-first development requirements and README.md for project-specific implementation guidance.**

### Step 3: Complete Development

**ðŸŽ¯ For ongoing development work, use [Workflow 3: Development Flow](/docs/AGENTS_DEVELOPMENT.md) patterns**

Continue development until the issue is fully resolved:

```bash
# Commit freely during development - these will be cleaned up later
git commit -m "add user authentication tests"
git commit -m "implement login validation"
git commit -m "fix edge case for empty passwords"
git commit -m "add integration tests for auth flow"
git commit -m "refactor validation logic"
```

### Step 4: Create PR for Review

**ðŸ“– CRITICAL: Follow CONTRIBUTING.md Step 3 for exact process requirements.**

**4a. Create PR:**

**Prepare PR body:**

- Copy the template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Create `.PR_BODY.md` in the project root using your code editor
- Fill out all sections completely

**Create the PR:**

```bash
# Get the exact issue title for consistency
./scripts/get_issue_title.sh <issue-number>

# Create PR, add --push to eliminates the interactive prompt.
gh pr create \
  --title "<issue-title> #<issue-number>" \
  --body-file .PR_BODY.md \
  --base main
  --push

# Clean up the temporary file
rm .PR_BODY.md
```

**4b. Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Code follows standards (TOC at the top of files, functions >10 lines documented)
- [ ] Clean commit history with proper format
- [ ] PR template fully completed
- [ ] PR title matches issue title exactly + `#<issue-number>`

### Step 5: Clean Up

Your work is done. Ensure all temporary files are removed.
