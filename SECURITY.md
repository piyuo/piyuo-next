## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

**Please do NOT open a public issue or pull request to report a security vulnerability.**

Instead, we encourage you to report security vulnerabilities through **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature**. This ensures that the vulnerability remains confidential until we have a chance to address it.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

1.  **Navigate to the Security Tab:** Go to the "Security" tab of this repository on GitHub.
2.  **Click "Report a vulnerability":** On the left sidebar, under "Security Advisories," click on the "Report a vulnerability" button.
3.  **Fill out the form:** Provide as much detail as possible, including:
    * A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    * The affected versions of the project.
    * The potential impact of the vulnerability.
    * Any suggested mitigations or fixes (if you have them).

### Our Process

* **Acknowledgement:** You can expect an initial acknowledgment of your report within **[e.g., 2 business days]**.
* **Investigation:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability and work to confirm its presence and impact.
* **Updates:** We will provide regular updates on the status of your report, typically every **[e.g., 5 business days]**.
* **Resolution:** Once the vulnerability is confirmed and a fix is developed, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure process, including setting a reasonable disclosure timeline (usually after the fix is publicly released).
* **Credit:** We are happy to credit you for your responsible disclosure, if you wish to be acknowledged.

### Scope

Please ensure your report falls within the scope of our project and its components. We focus on vulnerabilities directly impacting the functionality, data integrity, and security of [Your Project Name].

We kindly ask that you avoid any activities that could negatively impact our services or users during your testing.
