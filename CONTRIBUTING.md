# Contributing Guide

> **Complete Development Workflow:** This guide covers the entire development lifecycle from issue creation to automated releases, following a test-first approach with clean Git history.

**Note:** Code examples in this document use JavaScript for demonstration purposes. For the actual programming language, frameworks, and tech stack used in this project, please refer to the README.md file.

## üìã Quick Start Workflow

Here's the complete development workflow at a glance:

1. **Create Issue** ‚Üí Use AI Issue Assistant or templates
2. **Create Branch** ‚Üí Using `./scripts/start-issue.sh <issue-number>`
3. **Create Draft PR** ‚Üí Early communication and collaboration
4. **Write Tests First** ‚Üí Test-driven development (TDD) approach
5. **Develop & Commit** ‚Üí Frequent commits with descriptive messages
6. **Clean History** ‚Üí Squash into meaningful commits before review
7. **Create PR** ‚Üí Request review with proper title format
8. **Merge** ‚Üí Maintainer performs rebase and merge
9. **Auto-Release** ‚Üí Release-please handles versioning when milestone complete

---

## üéØ Step 1: Create Issue

All work must begin with a GitHub Issue to ensure proper tracking and milestone alignment.

### Issue Creation Options

**AI Assist Issue** (Recommended) - Use the AI-powered issue template `AI Assist Issue`, the detailed document can be found in   `docs/AI_ISSUE_ASSISTANT.md`

### Large Feature Management

For complex features, use **Epic + Sub-issues** approach:

1. **Epic Issue** - Main feature request with overview
2. **Team Planning** - Collaborative breakdown into sub-issues (1-2 days each)
3. **Sub-issue Creation** - Each with clear acceptance criteria
4. **Team Assignment** - Developers claim specific sub-issues

---

## üåø Step 2: Create Issue Branch

**ALWAYS** use the provided script to start working on any issue:

```bash
./scripts/start-issue.sh <issue-number>
```

This script will:
- Create a branch named `<issue-number>-<slugified-title>` from `main`
- Assign the issue to you
- Check out the new branch

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Run from project root directory

---

## üìù Step 3: Create Draft PR for Early Communication

**RECOMMENDED:** Create a Draft PR immediately after creating your branch to enable early communication and collaboration.

### Why Create Draft PRs Early?

- **Communicate your approach** before significant development
- **Get feedback on direction** from team members and AI agents
- **Document your thinking process** in PR comments
- **Enable collaborative problem-solving**
- **Avoid rework** by validating approach early

### Creating a Draft PR

```bash
# Create draft PR using GitHub CLI
gh pr create --draft --title "<issue-title> #<issue-number>" --body "<initial-approach>" --base main
```

### Draft PR Best Practices

**Use PR Comments to:**

- Explain your planned approach
- Ask questions about implementation details
- Share discoveries and learnings
- Request feedback on specific design decisions
- Document any blockers or challenges

### When to Ask for Help

**ALWAYS ask for help when you:**

- If the issue requirements are unclear
- Are unsure about the best technical approach
- Encounter unfamiliar technologies or patterns
- Face blockers that you can't resolve
- Need clarification on project conventions
- Are stuck on implementation details

**HOW to ask for help:**

1. **Comment in your Draft PR** with specific questions
2. **Tag relevant team members** or use `@team` mentions
3. **Provide context** about what you've tried
4. **Be specific** about what you need help with

**Example Help Request:**

```markdown
## Need Help üÜò

I'm stuck on implementing the payment integration. I've reviewed the API docs but I'm not sure how to handle webhook verification.

**What I've tried:**
- Read Stripe webhook documentation
- Looked at existing webhook handlers in the codebase
- Attempted to implement signature verification

**Specific questions:**
- How should we store webhook secrets securely?
- Should webhook processing be synchronous or queued?
- Are there existing utilities for webhook validation I should use?

**Context:**
Working on Issue #142 - Payment gateway integration
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Write Tests First (TDD)

**MANDATORY:** Write tests before implementing functionality. This test-first approach ensures:
- Code is testable and well-designed
- Edge cases are considered upfront
- Immediate feedback when implementation is complete
- Living documentation for expected behavior

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: ‚â•80% coverage for new code
- **Integration Tests**: Required for APIs and complex workflows
- **E2E Tests**: Required for critical user journeys

### Test File Structure

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.test.js    # Unit tests

```

### Test Examples

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Testing behavior and user interactions
test('displays error message when form submission fails', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const component = render(<ContactForm />);

  // Act
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }));

  // Assert
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText(/submission failed/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

---

## üíª Step 5: Development & Commit

### Code Standards

#### File Size Limits

- **Target:** ‚â§200 lines per file (excluding comments/blank lines)
- **Refactor if exceeded:** Extract components, utilities, types, or functions

#### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** Follow project conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
- **Variables/Functions:** camelCase (`userName`, `handleSubmit`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)

#### Comments (Required for functions >10 lines)

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total price of items in cart after applying discount and tax.
 *
 * @param {Array} items - Array of cart items with price and quantity
 * @param {number} discountRate - Discount rate as decimal (e.g., 0.10 for 10%)
 * @param {number} taxRate - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
 * @returns {number} The final total price including tax and discount
 */
function calculateCartTotal(items, discountRate, taxRate) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

#### Import Organization

```javascript
// 1. Standard library imports
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// 2. Third-party library imports
import express from 'express';
import lodash from 'lodash';

// 3. Internal imports
import { Button } from './components/Button';
import { validateEmail } from './utils/validation';

// 4. Relative imports
import './styles.css';
```

### Development Phase Commits

During development, commit frequently with any messages you find helpful:

```bash
# Examples of work-in-progress commits (will be cleaned up later)
git commit -m "WIP: initial authentication setup"
git commit -m "add password validation logic"
git commit -m "fix: handle edge case for empty passwords"
git commit -m "debug: add logging for troubleshooting"
```

**Development Phase Freedom:**

- Commit as frequently as you want with any message style
- Use WIP, debug, typo fix, or any other commit messages
- Focus on progress, not commit message perfection
- These commits will be cleaned up before review

---

## üßπ Step 6: Clean Commit History

**CRITICAL:** You MUST clean up your commit history before creating a PR or converting Draft PR to ready for review.

### Commit Message Requirements (Enforced by Commitlint)

All commit messages are automatically validated by commitlint and must follow these strict rules:

#### Commitlint Rules

1. **Header Maximum Length**: Commit message header must not exceed 100 characters
2. **Subject Not Empty**: The commit message subject cannot be empty
3. **Issue Number Required**: All commits must end with ` #<issue-number>` (space + hash + number)
   - Exception: Commits starting with `chore(main):` are exempt from this rule
4. **Body Leading Blank Line**: Blank line required between header and body (if body exists)
5. **Body Maximum Line Length**: Each body line must not exceed 100 characters
6. **Footer Leading Blank Line**: Blank line required between body and footer (if footer exists)
7. **Footer Maximum Line Length**: Each footer line must not exceed 100 characters
8. **Scope Case**: Scope must be lowercase (e.g., `feat(auth):` not `feat(AUTH):`)
9. **Header Full Stop**: Header must not end with a period (.)
10. **Type Required**: Commit must have a valid type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
11. **Subject Full Stop**: Subject must not end with a period (.)

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject> #<issue-number>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Valid Examples

```bash
feat(auth): implement user authentication system #17
fix(payment): resolve gateway timeout issues #142
docs(readme): update installation guide #78
refactor(db): optimize query performance #201
chore(deps): update dependency versions #15
```

#### Invalid Examples (Will Fail Commitlint)

```bash
‚ùå feat(AUTH): implement user authentication system #17  (scope not lowercase)
‚ùå feat(auth): implement user authentication system.     (no issue number)
‚ùå feat(auth): implement user authentication system. #17 (ends with period)
‚ùå feat(auth): #17                                      (empty subject)
‚ùå feat(auth): implement user authentication system that handles OAuth, JWT tokens, and session management for our application #17 (exceeds 100 chars)
```

### Before Requesting Review (Mandatory)

Transform messy development commits into **1-n meaningful commits** (typically 1 per issue).

#### Interactive Rebase Process

```bash
# First, sync with latest main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Clean up commits using interactive rebase
git rebase -i origin/main

# In the interactive editor:
# - Keep the first commit as 'pick'
# - Change others to 'squash' or 'fixup'
# - Save and exit
# - Edit the final commit message following commitlint rules

# Force push safely
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

### Commit Cleanup Guidelines

**What to squash/remove:**

- ‚ùå WIP commits
- ‚ùå Typo fixes
- ‚ùå Debug commits
- ‚ùå "Fix review comments"
- ‚ùå Any noisy, non-meaningful commits

**What constitutes meaningful commits:**

- ‚úÖ `feat(auth): implement user authentication system #17`
- ‚úÖ `fix(pay): resolve payment gateway timeout issues #142`
- ‚úÖ `refactor(db): optimize database query performance #201`
- ‚úÖ `docs(api): add API authentication guide #78`

### Final Commit Requirements

Your cleaned commits must follow these requirements:

- **Use conventional commit format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description> #<issue-number>`
- **Must include issue number** - **MANDATORY** for all commits (except `chore(main):`)
- **Must be `feat:` or `fix:`** to trigger version updates (unless it's docs/refactor/chore)
- **Include lowercase scope** for better categorization (auth, dash, pay, etc.)
- **Keep header under 100 characters**
- **No period at end of header**
- **Be descriptive and actionable**

#### Good Examples (Pass Commitlint)

```bash
feat(dash): add user dashboard with activity metrics #95
fix(pay): resolve payment gateway connection timeout #142
refactor(db): optimize database query performance #201
docs(readme): update API authentication guide #78
chore(deps): update dependency versions #15
```

#### Bad Examples (Fail Commitlint)

```bash
‚ùå feat(DASH): add user dashboard #95                    (scope not lowercase)
‚ùå feat(dash): add user dashboard                        (missing issue number)
‚ùå feat(dash): add user dashboard. #95                   (ends with period)
‚ùå feat(dash): add comprehensive user dashboard with activity metrics and charts #95 (too long)
```

## üîÄ Step 7: Create/Update Pull Request

### Converting Draft PR to Ready for Review

If you created a Draft PR in Step 3, update it when ready:

1. **Clean up commit history** (completed in Step 6)
2. **Update PR title and description** if needed
3. **Convert to ready for review**:
   ```bash
   gh pr ready <pr-number>
   ```

### Creating New PR (If No Draft)

1. **Get the exact issue title**:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/get-issue-title.sh <issue-number>
   ```

2. **Create PR using GitHub CLI**:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<issue-title> #<issue-number>" --body "<filled-template>" --base main
   ```

### PR Title Format

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <description> #<issue-number>
```

**Format Requirements:**
- Header must be ‚â§100 characters
- Scope must be lowercase
- No period at end of header
- Must include issue number (except `chore(main):`)

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(auth): add user authentication system #95
fix(pay): resolve payment gateway timeout #142
docs(readme): update API authentication guide #78
```

### PR Template Requirements

**Required Sections:**

- **Checklist** - Code standards, testing, documentation
- **Testing** - How changes were tested, evidence provided
- **Deployment Notes** - Any special deployment considerations
- **Reviewer Notes** - Specific areas for review focus

### Pre-PR Checklist

Before creating/converting PR, ensure:

- [ ] Commits are cleaned up with meaningful messages
- [ ] All commits include issue number
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Code formatting applied (linting/prettier)
- [ ] Functions >10 lines have documentation comments
- [ ] Keep files under 200 lines when possible

### Review Process

1. **CODEOWNERS automatically assigned** as reviewers
2. **Address feedback promptly**
3. **All CI checks must pass** before merge
4. **At least one approval required** from CODEOWNERS

**Important:** Reviewers decide when to merge. Once they approve, they typically merge immediately. Ensure commits are clean BEFORE requesting review.

---

## üöÄ Step 8: Merge (Rebase Strategy)

### Merge Process

- **Only "Rebase and merge" allowed** - other options are disabled
- **Maintainer performs the merge** after approval
- **Commits appear on main exactly as they exist on feature branch**
- **Branch automatically deleted** after merge

### Branch Management

**Automatic Branch Deletion:** After pull requests are merged, issue branches are deleted automatically since we use rebase and merge strategy.

#### Recreating Branches for Debugging

If you need to recreate an issue branch:

1. **Find the issue commit** in main branch history
2. **Copy the commit SHA**
3. **Create new branch** from that commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b debug-branch <commit-SHA>
   ```

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Step 9: Auto-Release

### Release-Please Automation

**Release-please** automatically handles versioning and releases by:

1. **Analyzing commit messages** on main branch
2. **Determining version type** based on conventional commits:
   - `feat:` commits ‚Üí Minor version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.2.0)
   - `fix:` commits ‚Üí Patch version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1)
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` ‚Üí Major version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
3. **Generating changelog** from commit messages and linked issues
4. **Creating release PR** with version bump and changelog
5. **Creating Git tags** when release PR is merged

### Milestone Completion

When all issues in a milestone are completed:
1. **Release-please creates release PR** automatically
2. **Maintainer reviews and merges** release PR to main
3. **Automatic version bump and changelog** generation
4. **Git tag created** with version number
5. **CI/CD deployment triggered** automatically

```

### Benefits
- **Instant issue identification** from any commit on main branch
- **One-click navigation** from commit to issue via #issue-number
- **Streamlined code archaeology** - easily trace why changes were made
- **Automated issue closing** - GitHub closes issues when PR with `#issue-number` is merged
- **Perfect audit trail** - every commit is linked to its originating issue

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: What are the commitlint rules I need to follow?**
A: **All commits are validated by commitlint**. Key rules: header ‚â§100 chars, lowercase scope, must end with ` #<issue-number>`, no periods at end of header, and proper conventional commit format. See the "Commit Message Requirements" section for full details.

**Q: My commit is failing commitlint validation. What should I check?**
A: **Common issues**: header too long (>100 chars), uppercase scope, missing issue number, ending with period, or empty subject. Use `git commit --amend` to fix the message.

**Q: Should I create a Draft PR early or wait until I'm done?**
A: **Create a Draft PR early** (Step 3) to communicate your approach and get feedback. This prevents rework and enables collaboration with team members and AI agents.

**Q: When should I ask for help?**
A: **Always ask when you're unsure**. Don't guess or make up solutions. Use Draft PR comments to ask specific questions about requirements, technical approach, or any blockers you encounter.

**Q: When exactly should I clean up my commits?**
A: **Before creating a PR or converting Draft PR to ready for review**. This is mandatory - reviewers expect clean, meaningful commits with issue numbers.

**Q: Can I keep WIP commits in my PR?**
A: **No**. All WIP, typo fixes, debug commits, and other noisy commits must be squashed before review.

**Q: Do all my commits need to have issue numbers?**
A: **Yes, this is now MANDATORY**. Every commit must include the issue number (e.g., `#123`) for complete traceability.

**Q: What's the easiest way to clean up commits?**
A: **Use interactive rebase** (`git rebase -i origin/main`) to squash commits and rewrite commit messages.

**Q: Why write tests first?**
A: Test-first development ensures your code is testable, forces you to think about requirements upfront, and provides immediate feedback when implementation is complete.

**Q: What if I need to work on multiple issues?**
A: Each issue must have its own branch and milestone assignment. Each commit must reference its specific issue number.

**Q: How do I handle breaking changes?**
A: Use the exclamation mark syntax to trigger a major version bump:
```bash
feat!(auth): change user ID from int to UUID #123
```
